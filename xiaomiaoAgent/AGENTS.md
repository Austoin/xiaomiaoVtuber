# xiaomiaoAgent 开发协作指南

This file provides guidance to code agents and contributors working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

nanobot is a lightweight, open-source AI agent framework written in Python with a React/TypeScript WebUI. It centers around a small agent loop that receives messages from chat channels, invokes an LLM provider, executes tools, and manages session memory.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Python: run single test / lint
pytest tests/test_openai_api.py::test_function -v
ruff check nanobot/

# WebUI: dev server (proxies API/WS to gateway :8765), build, test
# Build outputs to ../nanobot/web/dist (bundled into the Python wheel)
cd webui && npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5174
cd webui && npm run build
cd webui && npm run test

# Gateway
python -m xiaomiao_agent gateway --config F:\xiaomiaoVirtual\.cache\agent\nanobot\config.json
```

## High-Level Architecture

### Core Data Flow

Messages flow through an async `MessageBus` (`nanobot/bus/queue.py`) that decouples chat channels from the agent core:

1. **Channels** (`nanobot/channels/`) receive messages from external platforms and publish `InboundMessage` events to the bus.
2. **`AgentLoop`** (`nanobot/agent/loop.py`) consumes inbound messages, builds context, and coordinates the turn.
3. **`AgentRunner`** (`nanobot/agent/runner.py`) handles the actual LLM conversation loop: send messages to the provider, receive tool calls, execute tools, and stream responses.
4. Responses are published as `OutboundMessage` events back to the appropriate channel.

### Key Subsystems

- **Agent Loop** (`nanobot/agent/loop.py`, `runner.py`): The core processing engine. `AgentLoop` manages session keys, hooks, and context building. `AgentRunner` executes the multi-turn LLM conversation with tool execution.
- **LLM Providers** (`nanobot/providers/`): Provider implementations (Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, Azure, GitHub Copilot, etc.) built on a common base (`base.py`). `factory.py` and `registry.py` handle instantiation and model discovery.
- **Channels** (`nanobot/channels/`): Platform integrations (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Feishu, Matrix, WhatsApp, QQ, WeChat, WebSocket, etc.). `manager.py` discovers and coordinates them. Channels are auto-discovered via `pkgutil` scan + entry-point plugins.
- **Tools** (`nanobot/agent/tools/`): Agent capabilities exposed to the LLM: filesystem (read/write/edit/list), shell execution, web search/fetch, MCP servers, cron, notebook editing, subagent spawning, and `MyTool` for self-modification.
- **Memory** (`nanobot/agent/memory.py`): Session history persistence with Dream two-phase memory consolidation. Uses atomic writes with fsync for durability.
- **Session Management** (`nanobot/session/manager.py`): Per-session history, context compaction, and TTL-based auto-compaction.
- **Config** (`nanobot/config/schema.py`, `loader.py`): Pydantic-based configuration loaded from the source-tree cache path or `~/.nanobot/config.json` when installed elsewhere. Supports camelCase aliases for JSON compatibility.
- **Runtime cache** (`F:\xiaomiaoVirtual\.cache\agent\nanobot\`): source-tree runtime configuration, sessions, media, history, and workspace. Installed environments fall back to `~/.nanobot/`.
- **WebUI** (`webui/`): Vite-based React SPA that talks to the gateway over a WebSocket multiplex protocol. The dev server proxies `/api`, `/webui`, `/auth`, and WebSocket traffic to the gateway.

### Entry Points

- **CLI**: `nanobot/cli/commands.py`
- **Python SDK**: `nanobot/nanobot.py`
